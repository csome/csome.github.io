      <h1 id="csomegithubio">hello!</h1>

      <p>My name is Clarissa Somers. I study computer science and linguistics at Georgetown University. From 2015-6 I worked as a research assistant on <a href="https://www.ailla.utexas.org/islandora/object/ailla%3A243980">a project to document and archive the Zapotec and Chatino languages</a>, I did a software engineering internship at <a href="https://narrativescience.com/">Narrative Science</a> in the summer of 2017, and I TA'ed for <a href="http://jeremybolton.georgetown.domains/courses/ds/">Georgetown's undergraduate Data Structures course</a> for the Fall 2017 semester. My main interest outside of linguistics and computer science is horror movies. ðŸ‘»</p>

      </ul>

      <p><b>And here are some quotes I like (just for fun):</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>"I have time," the skull replied reflectively. "Itâ€™s really not so good to have time. Rush, scramble, desperation, that missed, that left behind, those others too big to fit into such a small space -- that's the way life was meant to be. Youâ€™re supposed to be too late for some things. Don't worry about it." - Peter S. Beagle, The Last Unicorn</li>
        <li>"There's something about flying a kite at night that's so unwholesome. - Marge Simpson, The Simpsons</li>
        <li>It gets easier. Every day, it gets a little easier. But you have to do it every day. That's the hard part. But it does get easier. - Bojack Horseman</li>
        <li>"You must have wished a million times to be normal."
          "No."
          "No?"
          "Iâ€™ve wished I had two heads. Or that I was invisible. Iâ€™ve wished for a fishâ€™s tail instead of legs. Iâ€™ve wished to be more special."
          "Not normal?"
        "Never." 
      - Katherine Dunn, Geek Love</li>
      </ul>
